About
------

Librarian converts XML-based markup language used by WL for writing books to
other formats, which are more suitable for presentation.

Currently we support:

 * HTML4, XHTML 1.0 (?)
 * Plain text
 * EPUB (XHTML based)
 * MOBI
 * print-ready PDF
 * FB2

Other features:

 * extract DublinCore meta-data from documents;
 * extract marked "themes" from documents.


Dependencies
------------

 * lxml <http://codespeak.net/lxml/>, version 2.2 or later
 * additional PDF converter dependencies:
   * XeTeX with support for Polish language
   * TeXML <http://getfo.org/texml/>
   * recommended: morefloats LaTeX package, version >=1.0c
     for dealing with documents with many motifs in one paragraph.

Installation
------------

Librarian uses standard Python distutils for packaging. After installing all the dependencies just run:

    python setup.py install

PDF converter also needs the Junicode-WL fonts (librarian/pdf/JunicodeWL-*.ttf) installed.
In Debian/Ubuntu, put those files in ~/.fonts/ and run `fc-cache'.

Usage
------

    book2html file1.xml [file2.xml ...]

To convert a series of files to plain text:

To convert a file to EPUB:
